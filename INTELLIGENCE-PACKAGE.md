## 🎓 How to Position This

**Don't say:** "We analyze Reddit threads"

**Say:** 
- "Strategic competitive intelligence from the last unfiltered focus group"
- "See what customers really think before they sanitize it for surveys"
- "The elimination funnel: know exactly why competitors get cut"
- "Battle-tested ad copy extracted from real purchase decision threads"

**Key differentiator:** Not just data. Strategic intelligence with action plan.
