## 📊 Why This Will Work

### 1. You Already Validated It
Your Reddit Intel skill found a $5k client in 48 hours. That's proof the model works.

### 2. Huge Market
- 500k+ freelance web developers (US alone)
- 50k+ web design agencies
- They ALL waste 10-20 hrs/week on prospecting

### 3. Better Than Alternatives
- **Upwork/Fiverr:** Race to bottom, 20% fees
- **LinkedIn Sales Nav:** Manual search, no context
- **Hunter.io:** Just emails, no leads
- **Manual Reddit:** 10-20 hrs/week

LeadFlow AI = Automated + AI-powered + Context + Templates

### 4. Low Risk, High Reward
- **Cost to build:** $0 (already built!)
- **Cost to run:** ~$200/mo @ 100 customers
- **Revenue @ 100 customers:** $40k/mo
- **Profit margin:** >95%

### 5. Scalable
More customers ≠ more work. It's all automated.
