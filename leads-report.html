        <p>My SaaS startup (B2B, about 30 employees) needs a complete website overhaul. Our current site was DIY'd three years ago and it shows. We're also basically invisible in search results despite having a solid product.



Budget is around $25-40k total. Timeline is flexible but ideally done in 3-4 month...</p>

        <p>One year ago I started building a SaaS in the running industry. Today the platform has generated over $1,200 in revenue from 165 direct sales, and more than 2,700 people have signed up. All traffic has been organic, and my only expenses so far have been web hosting.

        <p>Before I start, let's be clear about **what an AI Agent is not.**

AI models only know what they've been fed. They can't generate new knowledge. We, as entrepreneurs, create solutions that don't exist yet. That's something AI simply can't replicate. (That's why when you ask it for a generic way to "...</p>
