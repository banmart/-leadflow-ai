## 📧 Beta Outreach Email Templates

### Template 1: Warm Leads (UpGo Clients)
**Subject:** I built something that finds web design clients automatically

Hey [NAME],

Quick question: How much time do you spend each week looking for new clients?

I just built LeadFlow AI - it scans Reddit, LinkedIn, and social media 24/7 and finds people actively looking for web design services. Then it scores them by quality and sends you only the best opportunities.

I tested it for 48 hours and it found a thread where someone needed help with their business website. I replied, got a DM, and now have a $5k project.

I'm accepting 10 beta customers at 50% off ($149/mo instead of $297). You'll get:
- 20-50 qualified leads per week
- Real-time alerts when someone's looking
- Response templates that convert
- Lead scoring (A/B/C quality)

Want in? Just reply and I'll set you up today.

Best,
Steve @ UpGo Web AI Agency

P.S. - Beta customers get locked in at 50% off forever.

### Template 2: Cold Outreach (Agencies on LinkedIn)
**Subject:** Stop wasting 20 hours/week on lead gen

Hi [NAME],

I noticed you run [AGENCY NAME] - congrats on the growth!

Quick question: How are you currently finding new clients? Reddit? LinkedIn? Networking?

I built LeadFlow AI because I was spending 20 hours/week manually searching for prospects and still missing 90% of opportunities.

Now it runs 24/7 and finds high-intent leads automatically. Example: Someone posts "I need help building an ecommerce site for my startup" on Reddit. LeadFlow AI catches it, scores it (A/B/C), and sends me a Slack alert with a response template.

Result: 15% response rate vs 2% with cold email.

I'm accepting 10 beta customers at 50% off ($149-499/mo depending on volume). Want to see a demo?

Best,
Steve

## 🎯 Content Strategy

### Reddit Posts

**r/web_design:**
Title: "I built an AI that finds web design clients on Reddit automatically - here's what happened"

Body:
I got tired of spending 20 hours/week scrolling through Reddit looking for potential clients. So I built LeadFlow AI - it monitors Reddit 24/7, finds high-intent prospects, and sends me only the best opportunities.

Tested it for 48 hours. Found a thread where someone needed help with their business website. Replied with genuine advice. Got a DM. Now have a $5,000 project.

The AI looks for:
- Budget signals ("willing to pay", "$X budget")
- Urgency signals ("ASAP", "this week")
- Authority signals ("I'm the founder", "my company")
- Pain points ("struggling with", "need help")

Then scores each lead A/B/C and sends alerts.

I'm accepting 10 beta customers at 50% off. If you're a freelancer or agency owner spending hours hunting for leads, DM me.

**r/freelance:**
Title: "Stop wasting 20 hours/week finding clients - I automated it"

Body:
Freelancers: How much time do you waste searching for leads every week?

I used to spend 10-20 hours scrolling Reddit, LinkedIn, forums looking for "need a web developer" posts. Exhausting. And I still missed most opportunities.

So I built LeadFlow AI. It:
- Scans platforms 24/7
- Finds high-intent prospects
- Scores by quality (A/B/C)
- Sends real-time alerts
- Includes response templates

Result: Found me a $5k project in 48 hours.

Beta program open (50% off). If you're tired of manual prospecting, check it out.

### LinkedIn Post

I spent 20 hours last week manually searching for web design leads.

Found 3 "opportunities."

2 were DIY-ers with $500 budgets.
1 ghosted after the first call.

So I built LeadFlow AI.

It scans Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter 24/7.
Finds people actively looking for services.
Scores them by intent/budget/urgency.
Sends me only A/B grade leads.

Result: 48 hours of testing → $5,000 project.

Now I'm accepting 10 beta customers at 50% off.

If you're an agency owner or freelancer wasting hours on lead gen, DM me.

Let AI do the grunt work so you can focus on billable hours.

### Twitter Thread

1/ I wasted 20 hours last week searching for web design leads manually.

Found 3 "opportunities." All garbage.

So I built an AI to do it for me. 🧵

2/ LeadFlow AI monitors Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter 24/7

Finds posts like:
- "Need help building an ecommerce site"
- "Looking for a web developer ASAP"
- "Anyone know a good designer?"

3/ But not just keyword matching.

It uses AI to detect:
✅ Budget signals ("$5k budget")
✅ Urgency ("need it this week")
✅ Authority ("I'm the founder")
✅ Pain points ("struggling with")

Then scores A/B/C.

4/ I tested it for 48 hours.

Found a Reddit thread: "Anyone else prefer simple small business websites?"

Replied with genuine advice (no pitch).

Got a DM.

Now have a $5,000 project.

5/ The difference vs cold email:

Cold email: 2% response rate
LeadFlow AI leads: 15% response rate

Why? You're joining a conversation where they're ALREADY asking for help.

6/ Now accepting 10 beta customers at 50% off.

$149/mo (normally $297)
20-50 qualified leads/week
Real-time alerts
Response templates

DM for access.
