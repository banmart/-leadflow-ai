## 📝 Initial Tweets (Post These First Week)

### Tweet 1: Launch Announcement
```
Introducing LeadFlow AI 🤖

Tired of wasting 20 hours/week manually searching for web design leads on Reddit & LinkedIn?

We built an AI that does it for you. Automatically.

✅ 20-50 qualified leads/week
✅ Real-time alerts
✅ Response templates
✅ A/B/C scoring

Beta: 50% off (10 spots)

Thread 👇
```

### Tweet 2: The Problem (Thread)
```
1/ I spent 20 hours last week searching for web design leads manually.

Found 3 "opportunities."

2 were DIY-ers with $500 budgets.
1 ghosted after the first call.

So I built an AI to do it for me. 🧵
```

### Tweet 3: How It Works
```
2/ LeadFlow AI monitors Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter 24/7

Finds posts like:
• "Need help building an ecommerce site"
• "Looking for a web developer ASAP"
• "Anyone know a good designer?"

But it doesn't just find keywords...
```

### Tweet 4: The AI Secret
```
3/ It uses AI to detect:

✅ Budget signals ("$5k budget", "willing to pay")
✅ Urgency ("need it this week", "ASAP")
✅ Authority ("I'm the founder", "my company")
✅ Pain points ("struggling with", "broken")

Then scores each lead A/B/C.
```

### Tweet 5: Proof
```
4/ I tested it for 48 hours.

Found a Reddit thread: "Anyone else prefer simple small business websites?"

Replied with genuine advice (no pitch).

Got a DM.

Now have a $5,000 project.

That's the power of joining conversations where people are ALREADY asking for help.
```

### Tweet 6: Results
```
5/ The difference vs cold email:

Cold email: 2% response rate
LeadFlow AI leads: 15% response rate

Why?

Because you're not interrupting them.
You're helping when they're actively looking.

Warm leads > Cold outreach
```

### Tweet 7: Beta CTA
```
6/ Now accepting 10 beta customers at 50% off.

$149/mo (normally $297)
• 20-50 qualified leads/week
• Real-time Slack/Telegram alerts
• Response templates that convert
• Lead scoring (A/B/C)

DM "BETA" for early access.

Or: leadflowai.com
```

## 📅 Content Calendar (Week 1)

### Monday
**Morning (8am):**
```
Every agency owner I know spends 10-20 hours/week searching for leads manually.

Here's why that's broken: 🧵
```

**Evening (6pm):**
```
Just found 23 high-intent leads in the last 24 hours using LeadFlow AI.

Manual searching would've taken me 8 hours.

The AI took 30 seconds.

That's 16x faster. And it never sleeps.

Beta: leadflowai.com
```

### Tuesday
**Morning (9am):**
```
Reddit lead generation hack:

Don't search for "need web developer"

Search for:
• "website looks outdated"
• "struggling with our site"
• "cart isn't working"

These are PAIN POINTS.

People in pain buy faster than people browsing.

LeadFlow AI finds these automatically.
```

**Afternoon (2pm):**
```
If you're still manually prospecting in 2026, you're doing it wrong.

AI can:
✅ Monitor 100+ subreddits 24/7
✅ Score leads by quality
✅ Send real-time alerts
✅ Generate response templates

While you sleep.

Beta: leadflowai.com 🤖
```

### Wednesday
**Morning (8am):**
```
Real conversation I had yesterday:

"How do you find clients?"
"Reddit, but it takes forever"
"What if AI did it for you?"
"I'd pay for that"

So I built it.

LeadFlow AI → leadflowai.com
```

**Evening (7pm):**
```
Unpopular opinion:

Cold outreach is dead.

2% response rate = 98% waste of time.

The future is WARM outreach:
- Find people actively looking
- Join the conversation
- Provide value first
- Close naturally

That's what LeadFlow AI does.
```

### Thursday
**Morning (10am):**
```
Lead quality matters more than lead quantity.

100 random emails = 2 responses = 0 sales

10 high-intent prospects = 3 responses = 1 sale

LeadFlow AI gives you the 10.

Scores every lead 0-100 based on:
• Budget
• Urgency
• Authority
• Pain points

Quality > Quantity
```

**Afternoon (4pm):**
```
Here's what $5,000 of my time looks like:

20 hours/week × 4 weeks = 80 hours
80 hours × $75/hr = $6,000

I was spending $6,000/month on manual prospecting.

LeadFlow AI costs $149/month.

ROI: 40x

Beta: leadflowai.com
```

### Friday
**Morning (9am):**
```
Friday reminder:

Your competitors are prospecting this weekend.

But LeadFlow AI works 24/7.

Including weekends.
Including holidays.
While you sleep.

Who do you think finds more leads?

Beta (3 spots left): leadflowai.com 🤖
```

**Afternoon (5pm):**
```
Weekend project idea:

Set up LeadFlow AI tonight.

Wake up Monday with 15-20 warm leads in your inbox.

Close 2-3 calls by Wednesday.

Start a new project by Friday.

That's the power of automation.

Beta: leadflowai.com
```

## 🔥 Viral Tweet Ideas

### 1. Before/After

Manual prospecting:
