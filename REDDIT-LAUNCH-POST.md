# Reddit Launch Posts

## Post #1: r/webdev, r/web_design, r/freelance

**Title:** I built an AI that found me a $5k client in 48 hours. Now it's a SaaS product.

**Body:**

Three months ago, I was wasting 15+ hours every week scrolling through Reddit looking for potential clients.

You know the drill:
- r/web_design
- r/Entrepreneur  
- r/smallbusiness
- Hoping to find someone saying "I need a website"

**The problem:** By the time I found a good lead, 10 competitors had already replied.

So I built an AI tool that monitors Reddit 24/7 and alerts me when high-intent prospects appear.

**First test:** Found a SaaS founder in r/Entrepreneur asking about redesigning their site. Budget: $5k. I replied in 20 minutes. Closed the deal.

**What it does:**
- Scans Reddit every hour
- Detects intent signals (budget, urgency, decision-making authority)
- Scores leads A/B/C (0-100 scale)
- Sends real-time alerts

**I'm now launching it as a SaaS product:** https://leadsflowbot.com

Beta pricing is 50% off lifetime ($149-499/mo depending on volume).

**Honest question:** Would this be useful for you? Or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?

Open to feedback.

## Post #2: r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Built a lead gen tool that pays for itself with 1 client

**Body:**

Quick backstory: I run a web design agency. Prospecting was killing me.

**The math that made me build this:**

- 15 hours/week finding leads manually
- At $100/hr value = $1,500/week wasted
- Most "leads" were tire-kickers or competitors

**What I built:**

AI-powered Reddit monitor that finds people actively looking to hire web designers/developers.

Not keyword matching. Actual AI that understands context:
- "I need a website" ✅
- "What's your budget?" ✅  
- "Looking to hire ASAP" ✅
- "I'm a web designer looking for clients" ❌ (filters out)

**Real result:** Found $5k project in first 48 hours.

**Now:** Launching as SaaS. $149-499/mo. 50% off for first 50 customers.

**ROI:** If it finds you 1 client, it pays for itself for months/years.

**Question for other agency owners:** What's your current lead gen process? Is it working?

## Post #3: r/SaaS (meta - selling a SaaS)

**Title:** Built and launched a SaaS in 3 weeks. Here's the validation process.

**Body:**

**Product:** AI-powered lead generation for web agencies  
**Build time:** 3 weeks  
**Tech stack:** Python, Reddit API, OpenAI, Stripe  
**Launch date:** Today

**Validation process:**

1. **Problem:** I was wasting 15 hrs/week manually prospecting on Reddit
2. **MVP:** Python script that scans subreddits for keywords
3. **Test:** Found $5k client in 48 hours
4. **Validation:** Showed to 5 agency owners, all said "take my money"
5. **Build:** Wrapped it in a SaaS with email delivery + lead scoring

**Current status:**
- Landing page live: https://leadsflowbot.com
- Beta pricing: $149-499/mo (50% off lifetime)
- First 10 customers get priority support

**What I learned:**
- Don't build features you don't need yet
- Solve your own problem first
- Manual delivery is fine for first 10 customers
- Ship fast, iterate based on feedback

**Revenue goal:** 10 customers in Week 1 = $2,500 MRR

Open to questions about the build/launch process.

## Post #4: r/startups

**Title:** Launched a B2B SaaS today. What marketing channels worked for you in Week 1?

**Body:**

**Product:** LeadFlow AI - automated lead generation for web agencies  
**Launch:** Today  
**Pricing:** $149-499/mo (beta 50% off)  
**Link:** https://leadsflowbot.com

**My plan for Week 1:**
- Reddit posts (this + other relevant subs)
- LinkedIn post to my network
- Email 10 warm contacts (agency owners I know)

**Target:** 5 beta customers = $745 MRR

**Question for this community:**

What marketing channels actually worked for you in your first week?

I know the playbook is "do things that don't scale" but curious what specifically moved the needle.

Thanks in advance for any advice!
